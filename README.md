This program is a demo of my abilities using Windows Forms in C#. It is a simple program that allows the user to select a tennis player off of a dropdown menu, then click to see how many total US Open wins they have. It also calculates the total back-to-back US Open winners, and allows the user to see a historical list of winners.
